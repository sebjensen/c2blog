They engage the user and keep them interested in the content that will be delivered to them by my interactive kiosk product. I identified a number of interactive features that I wish to recreate in my initial research document as part of the pre-production process for my project.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I donâ€™t think I want to include too many animations, but I will be able to use the functionality within PowerPoint to create a gallery as well as attract users to a start button on the splash screen.</span></p><h2>Animations</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have used the animations pane functionality included in PowerPoint to create a looping growing animation on the start button. I have used the same asset that I created a couple of sessions ago. This will attract users to the start button, having them press it to begin the experience with the trailer for RLCS that I also downloaded when collecting assets from the source.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/Animated-start-button.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-xs.PNG 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-sm.PNG 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-md.PNG 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-lg.PNG 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-xl.PNG 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="803" height="765"></figure><h2>Interactive features</h2><h3>Videos</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish to include the trailer for RLCS that I downloaded while collecting various assets from the source. To remove the unnecessary details at the end of the trailer and therefore make it more appropriate for my new audience, I have used the trim functionality included in PowerPoint to remove the end portion of the video. The slide should automatically advance at the same time the video ends. The inclusion of a video will benefit users who have limited knowledge of the Rocket League Championship Series and Rocket League Esports in general. It will also capture their attention and generate interest in the product, encouraging them to check out the various pages to learn more.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/Video-trim.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-xs.PNG 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-sm.PNG 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-md.PNG 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-lg.PNG 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-xl.PNG 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1493" height="848"></figure><h3>Buttons</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I considered the inclusion of various buttons with the creation of my own assets. I have always intended to incorporate a splash screen with a start button, and have animated it as detailed above. Buttons form the basis of kiosk navigation, as the device should be accessible with touch and by using a mouse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I intend to include buttons on most pages. These will be hyperlinked to other slides in the interactive kiosk, or link to external sources that are not affected by the offline operation of the kiosk. By including information from official websites, I can still offer up-to-date information and resources, such as the live Twitch stream as PowerPoint does not natively support the embedding of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design of buttons, which I have already considered, have a large impact on establishing hierarchy and orientating the user. Some may be larger and more prominent to suggest significance, while others are much smaller and offer less relevant information or lead to slides that are predicted to receive less traffic.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/Buttons.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-xs.PNG 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-sm.PNG 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-md.PNG 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-lg.PNG 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-xl.PNG 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1150" height="784"></figure><h3>Gallery</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who are entirely new to the game, let alone any sorts of Rocket League Esports such as RLCS, I am including a gallery of in-game screenshots to help convey the gist of the game visually. As opposed to offering an entire additional slide full of written content about how the game works, by presenting these users with images instead, they are able to form the concept of the game much more easily and naturally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am using PowerPointâ€™s trigger animation functionality to show and hide larger versions of a screenshot when their respective thumbnails are clicked. Then, when you click the thumbnail again, the large screenshot will hide. This means that the user can select which screenshot they wish to view a larger version of. I have used many of the original assets that I collected at the beginning of the production process in creating this gallery system.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/Gallery.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-xs.PNG 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-sm.PNG 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-md.PNG 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-lg.PNG 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-xl.PNG 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1488" height="774"></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can incorporate this gallery into its own slide that will be targeted at users who need to get a better understanding of Rocket League itself. In turn, this will make for a more accessible experience.</span></p><h2>Perspective project approach</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sessionâ€™s <strong>successes</strong> include the creation of various interactive features to include in my interactive kiosk product, as well as the use of some animations in a gallery and on a splash screen. These will be good for engaging the user, keeping them interested, and have them invest themselves in the information and experience that my kiosk will provide.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have been <strong>even better if</strong> I had created more gallery features to be used across my kiosk. The inclusion of a gallery full of Rocket League in-game screenshots will be highly beneficial to users who do not know much of the game and its premise. The same for images from LAN events, where teams compete in the same arena with each other, would also have gone a long way to further consolidate my introduction to the competitive elements of Rocket League.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This concludes my production milestone for my response to the brief. I intend now to shift my focus towards the post-production process of collating my assets and interactive features and combining them into my final kiosk product. I will begin doing so next session, establishing this as my <strong>short-term focus</strong>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My <strong>long-term goal</strong> is relevant to the testing and gathering of feedback for my product. To accompany my consistent evaluation of each sessionâ€™s work and achievements, I will also produce a final evaluation of my interactive kiosk once I have finished the project. These are important as they allow me to reflect on what went well and how I could improve my methods and approach to a similar product in the future.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 3, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/tags/esports-kiosk/">Esports Kiosk</a></li><li><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/tags/production/">Production</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/authors/seb-jensen/" class="invert" rel="author">Seb Jensen</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/website-layout-and-design.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Website layout and design</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/using-the-master-slide.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Using the master slide </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Pearson BTEC Level 1/Level 2 Tech Award in Creative Media Production</p><p><strong>Seb Jensen</strong></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
