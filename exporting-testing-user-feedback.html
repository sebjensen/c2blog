Exporting is a simple task with most consideration needing to go towards the file format. This, though, is still straightforward and I have opted to use the .ppsx (PowerPoint Slide Show) file format. It is important to mention that this is a proprietary format and any device that I wish to run my product on will require PowerPoint. The principle difference lies in how a .ppsx file launches directly to the slideshow view when opened, which is what I want as it makes setup quicker.</p><h2>Testing</h2><p>Using Google Sheets, I created a spreadsheet where I could lay out all of my product's functional and non-functional requirements. There was only one criterion in terms of non-functional testing as PowerPoint handles much of the product's behind-the-scenes operation. However, I have identified all the necessary components for the correct operation of my product at the user's end and categorised these by the slide they were relevant to.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/testing.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-xs.jpg 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-sm.jpg 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-md.jpg 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-lg.jpg 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-xl.jpg 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1529" height="704"></figure><p>I recognised that not everything would work on the first time building in an additional section to the right for an improved version where required. The majority of the specification was satisfied when testing the first time. However, there were a few criteria that was not met and I was then able to promptly rectify the issues. In creating this checklist I was able to quickly see what was not working and resolve this efficiently after running through the first time.</p><h2>User feedback</h2><p>After conducting my own testing, I invited my peers to get involved and share constructive criticism in terms of the user experience and their thoughts. This was a great process as it allowed me to gather qualitative data; I have recognised that checking against set criteria is only part of the equation - ultimately, it is real people who will be using the product and their preferences have to be accounted for, too.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/user-feedback.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-xs.jpg 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-sm.jpg 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-md.jpg 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-lg.jpg 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-xl.jpg 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="919" height="700"></figure><p>A lot of this constructive criticism pertained to the navigability of my interactive kiosk product. Thankfully, all the content was adequate, but it was the menu slide in particular that would benefit most from some additional work. I was then able to make the changes that I could in the same session. For example, a quick fix in particular was the addition of a button to the homepage as well as the inclusion of the social media buttons in the menu slide, too, as you can see below.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/user-feedback-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-md.jpg 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="459" height="303"></figure><p>Due to the inherent limitations of building a kiosk with PowerPoint as its 'engine', I was not able to act upon the feedback that suggested I have the kiosk reset when it is idle. While this might have been possible by duplicating the splash screen side and setting each slide to automatically advance after X seconds, this would have increased the file size dramatically, potentially slowing down the product's operation. I would also have to adjust all of the internal hyperlinks set up on buttons as they would then start linking to the wrong pages. This just was not practical to act upon at this stage in the development cycle.</p><h2>Perspective project approach</h2><p>I am pleased with my rigorous checklist-based and user-oriented testing, and I think this was my main <strong>strength </strong>from this session. Not only have I compared the product's functionality to a specification full of criteria that I set out, but I also was able to gather valuable feedback from my peers. I have been able to appreciate that user experience cannot be tested with mere tick boxes.</p><p>It would have been <strong>even better if </strong>I was able to collect even more feedback on the user experience from others in my class. I would then have been able to further aggregate comments and begin to prioritise the actions that I should undertake. For example, if a large group all mention one or two things, it would make sense for said things to be addressed first. I was still able to reference my feedback to make improvements as part of the design process, though.</p><p>This concludes the development of my interactive kiosk product. I believe I have been successful in reworking an existing product, in this case the Rocket League Esports website, for a new audience. My <strong>next steps </strong>for the next session/s is to write up a full, final evaluation considering all aspects of the process. In it, I also hope to outline some targets and goals for future development of this project and beyond.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 11, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/tags/esports-kiosk/">Esports Kiosk</a></li><li><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/tags/post-production/">Post-Production</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/authors/seb-jensen/" class="invert" rel="author">Seb Jensen</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/final-evaluation.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Final Evaluation</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/website-layout-and-design.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Website layout and design </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Pearson BTEC Level 1/Level 2 Tech Award in Creative Media Production</p><p><strong>Seb Jensen</strong></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
