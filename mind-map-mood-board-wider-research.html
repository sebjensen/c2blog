Specifically, I wish to recreate an esports website for a popular competitive gaming league, adapting it for a different audience by reworking it into a new kiosk format.</p><p>To develop my product I will begin initially with various pre-production processes and procedures to conduct ideation. This includes the creation of a mind map, various mood boards, and researching pre-existing products that I may wish to reimagine. These will orient myself adequately for the production and post-production milestones that will follow. I will then need to be evaluative and critical of my work.</p><p>In my response to the brief, I will be documenting my progress with this blog that you are reading. Setting short term and long term goals and targets will be critical to the successful creation of my product.</p><h2>Mind map</h2><p>Visualising a plethora of thoughts and concepts is easily done with the use of a mind map. By using labels, nodes, and sub-nodes, a multitude of ideas can be collated on a single page and I have harnessed the flexibility of mind maps to present my initial ideas on how I intend to respond to the brief. I am already set on reworking a pre-existing product to produce an interactive kiosk.</p><p class="msg msg--info">Mind map is on paper, in my CMP folder. This will be updated at a later date.</p><h2>Mood boards</h2><p>I compiled a large variety of esports material from numerous sources on the Internet to produce three initial mood boards. These cover the common themes of games with competitive and official esports series, examples of various esports organisation logos, and a plethora of pre-existing esports website.</p><p>In producing these mood boards, I am able to establish a visual and creative direction for the project. I intend to adapt an esports website into a kiosk which would be featured at an esports event and/or exhibition for the series. While I'm still undecided on the game, I'm leaning towards Rocket League, having investigated the various options for competitive gameplay and being a regular player of the game.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/c2b-01.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-01-xs.jpg 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-01-sm.jpg 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-01-md.jpg 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-01-lg.jpg 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-01-xl.jpg 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-01-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/c2b-02.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-02-xs.jpg 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-02-sm.jpg 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-02-md.jpg 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-02-lg.jpg 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-02-xl.jpg 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-02-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/c2b-03.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-03-xs.jpg 300w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-03-sm.jpg 480w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-03-md.jpg 768w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-03-lg.jpg 1024w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-03-xl.jpg 1360w, https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/1/responsive/c2b-03-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><h2>Wider research</h2><p>It is important to conduct presentable wider research into other products that may hold some relevance to me when I am creating a product in response to the brief. Having already investigated the variety of games with options for competitive gameplay on offer, I have decided to target my research towards three pre-existing interactive products.</p><p>I have examined the Rocket League Esports, F1 Esports, and Valorant Esports websites, looking for common themes and shared codes and conventions. I can see what specific terminology they employ and that I will need to replicate, as well as key features and consistent inclusions, particularly in terms of interactivity, that would be beneficial to include when I choose to reimagine one of these products.</p><p class="msg msg--info">Wider research document being worked on</p><h2>Perspective project approach</h2><p>To conclude (the majority of) my blog entries, I will ensure that I maintain a perspective approach to my response to the brief. In doing so, I will identify strengths and weaknesses, as well as my short term and long term goals and targets.</p><p><strong>Strengths </strong>include my establishment of the common themes and codes of conventions that are shared across pre-existing interactive products relevant to the esports and gaming industry. I have identified key features and means of interactivity that I will be able to consider and bring forward to my response to the brief.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses </strong>include the limited sample size for the wider research that I conducted, compared to the wide variety of media that I included while producing my mood boards. However, I believe that three pre-existing media products will still serve as a valuable reference for when I reimagine a pre-existing interactive product.</p><p>My <strong>short-term goal</strong>, specifically for the next session, is to consolidate my initial research by specifically focusing on the key features of the Rocket League Esports website. I have opted to rework said website, adapting it for a different audience by reformatting it into a kiosk experience.</p><p>As for a <strong>long-term target</strong>, I am looking to conduct thorough research into the Rocket League Esports website, which includes beginning to identify external assets that I might wish to utilise. I intend to reinforce my pre-production work with extra documents, such as wireframes and visualisation diagrams, as well as consider the structure and layout of my reimagined product.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 24, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/tags/esports-kiosk/">Esports Kiosk</a></li><li><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/tags/pre-production/">Pre-Production</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/authors/seb-jensen/" class="invert" rel="author">Seb Jensen</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/focused-research-identifying-key-features.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Focused research / Identifying key features</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Pearson BTEC Level 1/Level 2 Tech Award in Creative Media Production</p><p><strong>Seb Jensen</strong></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
