            <![CDATA[
                <p>The proper organisation of collected assets in a sensical folder structure is quintessential to an efficient workflow. In today's session, I have collected all the images, videos, and audio that I will need for me to rework the Rocket League Esports website in response to the brief. In my production documents folder, I have created a 'Source' sub-folder, which then branches into an intuitive setup with all the assets I have collected. At the top layer, I will also be able to make another folder for any adapted and newly created assets.</p>
<p>It is also important to ensure that all files and collected assets are named effectively and appropriately. I have ensured that all file names offer the necessary detail needed to understand its purpose and contents with or without a file preview. For example, "FR Instigator Title.png" makes it clear that the image is related to fan rewards ("FR"), and is the Instigator Title cosmetic in-game.</p>
<p>I have also considered file extensions and formats, balancing the need for alpha data in some assets (such as to allow transparency in a logo) and file size optimisation (where a .JPG might be used).</p>
<p>I am utilising Google Drive for Desktop to keep my files and data in sync with the cloud. This means that I will always have access to my files online, regardless of which device I am using.</p>

<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p>This session's <strong>strengths </strong>included my thorough consideration of file management and navigation when collecting and storing assets from the source (Rocket League Esports website). The setup is intuitive, and it is also stored in and synced with the cloud, so I can access it from any device in school.</p>
<p>It would have been <strong>even better if </strong>I was able to find individual .mp3 files for the in-game goal event chimes. While I still have all the audio, it is just in a single file, and I will need to cut through this and trim it down to the specific sound effect I want in the future. Having each chime sound effect separate would be more sensical.</p>
<p>Now that I have collected images, video, and audio, I can begin to look at creating my own assets in the next session as a <strong>short-term goal</strong>. I will also be able to adapt what I have collected and will also document this.</p>
<p>In the <strong>long-term</strong>, I will have to think about how I can incorporate the various interactive elements and features that I outlined in my initial research document. This included the use of buttons, galleries, and the inclusion of a video. I will be able to use the assets I have collected today for this.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>I am beginning the production phase of my reimagination of an existing product, specifically my reworking of the Rocket League Esports webpage. I have decided to do so with writing copy and editing the text on the source/original site. In doing so, I have also made use of hyperlinks to incorporate external, official source pages.</p>
<p>Text is essential to conveying meaning and purpose and the inclusion of hyperlinks serves to be beneficial. This will allow me to embed and draw in external information from sources not affected by the kiosk slideshow's offline-only operation.</p>
<h2>Writing, editing text</h2>
<p>I have collected copy from the source (the Rocket League Esports webpage) and adapted it for my response to the brief. In doing so, I have edited the font - changing the colour, adding bold elements and considered weighting, as well as add italic elements, too. This also includes hyperlinking words/phrases.</p>
<p>Consequently, the text featured in my final kiosk product will be more engaging and fit the design and layout more seamlessly. By cutting out unnecessary details, or alternatively adding more text where it is necessary, I have considered the user experience. This is designed to be a kiosk to be shown in an exhibition or showcase, and all users should be treated as new.</p>

<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
<p>I have used hyperlinks to bring in extra information and links to official, external resources from the original Rocket League Esports website. These links will be able to be opened in a browser from within the kiosk, and as such, can be used to provide access to other resources and information that can be kept up-to-date beyond the kiosk.</p>
<p>I can use the 'Action Settings' interface within PowerPoint to easily link up to external resources when an object is clicked. In this case, I have been able to highlight the text and apply the hyperlink to the Rocket League Twitch channel.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/hyperlink.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-md.jpg 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="780" height="564"></figure>
<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p><strong>Strengths </strong>included my use of hyperlinks to include access to external, official resources that will not be affected by the kiosk slideshow's offline operation. By linking to the Twitch channel, for example, users will be able to view the livestream.</p>
<p>It would be <strong>even better if </strong>I hyperlinked more of the text I have wrote and edited for my interactive kiosk. The same overarching reason for this persists - the kiosk will not be able to download and present data from the internet. Hyperlinks offer a means of showing accurate information from official sources.</p>
<p>My <strong>short-term goal</strong>, specifically for the next session, is to collect the sound, videos, and images that I will need for when I bring all of the elements together for my kiosk product. I intend to organise these in a sensical file structure, where all the files I will need for my product can easily be located with clear names.</p>
<p>My <strong>long-term focus </strong>remains on how I intend to bring all the elements together. This also includes what assets I want to and/or will need to create myself using production techniques I have previously experimented with. Eventually, I will also need to consider hierarchy can be harnessed to guide the user experience.</p>

                <p>I have conducted wider and focused initial research and identified key features, means of interactivity, sorts of assets I would need. I have also set out and determined the structure and layout of my reimagination of the Rocket League Esports website, in response to the brief while adapting it for a different audience.</p>
<p>I can now consolidate the creative direction I wish to follow and build upon my initial mind map and mood boards. Wireframes and visualisation diagrams are an adequate means of presenting how I wish my product to be designed and set out. In creating the following documents, I am satisfied that I have concluded the pre-production process.</p>
<h2>Wireframe</h2>
<p>Wireframes aid the pre-production process considerably, in that they allow you to create a quick sketch of where various elements will be placed and interact with one another. They are not time consuming to create as they are very basic diagrams, making them an efficient and effective pre-production document to produce and have on-hand during work towards the production and post-production milestones.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/wireframe-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-xs.png 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-sm.png 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-md.png 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="783" height="533"></figure>
<p>In the above I have laid out two high-traffic slides that will be implemented as part of my kiosk and reimagination of the Rocket League Esports website. I used boxes with crosses to denote images, and lines to denote text/copy. I have also included buttons and other icons and annotations to the side of the wireframe to elaborate on features.</p>
<p>It was particularly quick to produce these two wireframes, thus proving their efficacy in terms of an efficient pre-production workflow and cycle. I was able to include the key details surrounding layout and features with ease.</p>
<h2>Visualisation diagram</h2>
<p>Visualisation diagrams as a pre-production document could be considered an evolution upon a wireframe. It still demonstrates the desired layout and design, and includes more detail, of the specific design elements I'm wanting to use. They are a lot closer to how the final product will look, but are still relatively quick to produce.</p>
<p>I have taken the two wireframes I already produced and have progressed them into a visualisation diagram.</p>

<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p>I have clearly demonstrated my <strong>strengths </strong>in the creation of my last two pre-production documents, two wireframes and visualisation diagrams. I have consolidated my creative direction that I set out initially with my mind map and mood boards and developed with my focused research and consideration of structure and layout.</p>
<p>It would have been <strong>even better if </strong>I created more wireframes and visualisation diagrams to aid my efforts towards the production and post-production milestones. That said, though, it is important to consider the significance of time management when responding to a brief, and I believe I achieved a substantial amount with the sessions I dedicated to pre-production.</p>
<p>My <strong>goals </strong>now shift to the production and post-production milestones. In the short-term I will have to consider how I intend to progress through the production cycle. I intend to begin with writing and incorporating text and copy into the kiosk, and use hyperlinks to connect slides and external links. As I work through this, I will also need to continually think ahead into the long-term and consider how I intend to piece together all of these different elements.</p>

                <p>To build upon and consolidate the pre-production efforts from my last two sessions, I am taking the time to identify the key assets or sorts of assets that I would need to use when reimagining the Rocket League Esports homepage in response to the brief. This will satisfy the short-term goal I set out in my aim to take a perspective approach to the progression of my project. Following this, I will also consider the structure and layout and user experience of the product I am adapting for a kiosk format and wider audience.</p>
<h2>Identifying key assets</h2>
<p>I have built upon the brief reference to the assets I would need by dedicating part of the pre-production process to identifying media and sorts of media that are relevant to the reworked product I am producing.</p>

<h2>Structure and layout</h2>
<p>Ensuring I focus on the structure and layout of my interactive esports product will benefit me greatly when I begin utilising media production skills and techniques to rework the Rocket League Esports homepage. It can serve as a checklist of sorts, a specification that I can follow to ensure that I am including all of the functionality, information, and interactive features to create and develop a good, seamless, and intuitive user experience.</p>

<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong> include my direct response to my primary documented weakness from last session, the absence of substantial identified key assets. I have amended this by dedicating effort to the collation of various media that would be significant in my response to the brief.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses </strong>include the limited sample of key assets I have identified. However, I believe I have a satisfactory selection of assets that would be significant in my response to the brief. It is important to note that the management of both time and effort is paramount in maintaining an effective and efficient workflow.</p>
<p>My <strong>short-term goal </strong>now concerns the production of wireframes and visualisation diagrams, and I intend to achieve this goal in the next session. This will conclude my pre-production process upon completion.</p>
<p>In terms of <strong>long-term goals</strong>, my focus will now begin to shift to the production process, with consideration for the post-production process that will follow it. I need to round up my pre-production work and efforts before beginning to collect and organise the assets I intend to use as well as creating new assets that I need.</p>

                <p>I believe the scope of the Rocket League Esports website could be easily reimagined in the format of a kiosk as to adapt it for a different audience. Consequently, it is necessary that I conduct further, focused research on said interactive esports product so that I can adequately rework its features and elaborate upon it professionally. In doing so, I would also identify the key features of the website, and I will then be able to reference back to this developed research and product specification during the production and post-production process.</p>
<p>I detailed a brief outline of what I would like to achieve (setting targets for myself). I also identified the key colour scheme, some media assets I would need to utilise, and listed the key features of the Rocket League Esports homepage. The product of this session's efforts are embedded below:</p>

<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p><strong>Strengths </strong>include my identification of key interactive features, such as the fan rewards gallery, that I would be able to translate into a kiosk format by using the trigger animation functionality included in PowerPoint. This will ensure a more effective and efficient design workflow as I will already have detailed the content I intend to include.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses </strong>include the limited detailing of media that I would need to include when I reimagine the Rocket League Esports homepage. While I have mentioned the logo and two videos to include, there is little mention of what images I could include and modify to create my own assets.</p>
<p>My <strong>short-term goal </strong>is to identify the specific assets or sorts of assets that I would need to collect and collate to be used in my response to the brief. This rectifies the primary weakness of this session that I just detailed.</p>
<p>My <strong>long-term goal </strong>is to establish the structure and layout of the kiosk, supporting this with wireframe documents and, subsequently, the creation of various visualisation diagrams to support my production and post-production milestones.</p>

                <p>I am having to respond to a brief pertaining to the creation of an interactive esports product, and am doing so by reimagining an existing product. Specifically, I wish to recreate an esports website for a popular competitive gaming league, adapting it for a different audience by reworking it into a new kiosk format.</p>
<p>To develop my product I will begin initially with various pre-production processes and procedures to conduct ideation. This includes the creation of a mind map, various mood boards, and researching pre-existing products that I may wish to reimagine. These will orient myself adequately for the production and post-production milestones that will follow. I will then need to be evaluative and critical of my work.</p>
<p>In my response to the brief, I will be documenting my progress with this blog that you are reading. Setting short term and long term goals and targets will be critical to the successful creation of my product.</p>
<h2>Mind map</h2>
<p>Visualising a plethora of thoughts and concepts is easily done with the use of a mind map. By using labels, nodes, and sub-nodes, a multitude of ideas can be collated on a single page and I have harnessed the flexibility of mind maps to present my initial ideas on how I intend to respond to the brief. I am already set on reworking a pre-existing product to produce an interactive kiosk.</p>

<h2>Mood boards</h2>
<p>I compiled a large variety of esports material from numerous sources on the Internet to produce three initial mood boards. These cover the common themes of games with competitive and official esports series, examples of various esports organisation logos, and a plethora of pre-existing esports website.</p>
<p>In producing these mood boards, I am able to establish a visual and creative direction for the project. I intend to adapt an esports website into a kiosk which would be featured at an esports event and/or exhibition for the series. While I'm still undecided on the game, I'm leaning towards Rocket League, having investigated the various options for competitive gameplay and being a regular player of the game.</p>

<h2>Wider research</h2>
<p>It is important to conduct presentable wider research into other products that may hold some relevance to me when I am creating a product in response to the brief. Having already investigated the variety of games with options for competitive gameplay on offer, I have decided to target my research towards three pre-existing interactive products.</p>
<p>I have examined the Rocket League Esports, F1 Esports, and Valorant Esports websites, looking for common themes and shared codes and conventions. I can see what specific terminology they employ and that I will need to replicate, as well as key features and consistent inclusions, particularly in terms of interactivity, that would be beneficial to include when I choose to reimagine one of these products.</p>

<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p>To conclude (the majority of) my blog entries, I will ensure that I maintain a perspective approach to my response to the brief. In doing so, I will identify strengths and weaknesses, as well as my short term and long term goals and targets.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths </strong>include my establishment of the common themes and codes of conventions that are shared across pre-existing interactive products relevant to the esports and gaming industry. I have identified key features and means of interactivity that I will be able to consider and bring forward to my response to the brief.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses </strong>include the limited sample size for the wider research that I conducted, compared to the wide variety of media that I included while producing my mood boards. However, I believe that three pre-existing media products will still serve as a valuable reference for when I reimagine a pre-existing interactive product.</p>
<p>My <strong>short-term goal</strong>, specifically for the next session, is to consolidate my initial research by specifically focusing on the key features of the Rocket League Esports website. I have opted to rework said website, adapting it for a different audience by reformatting it into a kiosk experience.</p>
<p>As for a <strong>long-term target</strong>, I am looking to conduct thorough research into the Rocket League Esports website, which includes beginning to identify external assets that I might wish to utilise. I intend to reinforce my pre-production work with extra documents, such as wireframes and visualisation diagrams, as well as consider the structure and layout of my reimagined product.</p>
