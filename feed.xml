            <![CDATA[
                <p>I am now confident that my interactive kiosk product is ready to be exported and then tested. Exporting is a simple task with most consideration needing to go towards the file format. This, though, is still straightforward and I have opted to use the .ppsx (PowerPoint Slide Show) file format. It is important to mention that this is a proprietary format and any device that I wish to run my product on will require PowerPoint. The principle difference lies in how a .ppsx file launches directly to the slideshow view when opened, which is what I want as it makes setup quicker.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Using Google Sheets, I created a spreadsheet where I could lay out all of my product's functional and non-functional requirements. There was only one criterion in terms of non-functional testing as PowerPoint handles much of the product's behind-the-scenes operation. However, I have identified all the necessary components for the correct operation of my product at the user's end and categorised these by the slide they were relevant to.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/testing.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-md.jpg 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/testing-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1529" height="704"></figure>
<p>I recognised that not everything would work on the first time building in an additional section to the right for an improved version where required. The majority of the specification was satisfied when testing the first time. However, there were a few criteria that was not met and I was then able to promptly rectify the issues. In creating this checklist I was able to quickly see what was not working and resolve this efficiently after running through the first time.</p>
<h2>User feedback</h2>
<p>After conducting my own testing, I invited my peers to get involved and share constructive criticism in terms of the user experience and their thoughts. This was a great process as it allowed me to gather qualitative data; I have recognised that checking against set criteria is only part of the equation - ultimately, it is real people who will be using the product and their preferences have to be accounted for, too.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/user-feedback.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-md.jpg 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="919" height="700"></figure>
<p>A lot of this constructive criticism pertained to the navigability of my interactive kiosk product. Thankfully, all the content was adequate, but it was the menu slide in particular that would benefit most from some additional work. I was then able to make the changes that I could in the same session. For example, a quick fix in particular was the addition of a button to the homepage as well as the inclusion of the social media buttons in the menu slide, too, as you can see below.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/user-feedback-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/11/responsive/user-feedback-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="459" height="303"></figure>
<p>Due to the inherent limitations of building a kiosk with PowerPoint as its 'engine', I was not able to act upon the feedback that suggested I have the kiosk reset when it is idle. While this might have been possible by duplicating the splash screen side and setting each slide to automatically advance after X seconds, this would have increased the file size dramatically, potentially slowing down the product's operation. I would also have to adjust all of the internal hyperlinks set up on buttons as they would then start linking to the wrong pages. This just was not practical to act upon at this stage in the development cycle.</p>
<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p>I am pleased with my rigorous checklist-based and user-oriented testing, and I think this was my main <strong>strength </strong>from this session. Not only have I compared the product's functionality to a specification full of criteria that I set out, but I also was able to gather valuable feedback from my peers. I have been able to appreciate that user experience cannot be tested with mere tick boxes.</p>
<p>It would have been <strong>even better if </strong>I was able to collect even more feedback on the user experience from others in my class. I would then have been able to further aggregate comments and begin to prioritise the actions that I should undertake. For example, if a large group all mention one or two things, it would make sense for said things to be addressed first. I was still able to reference my feedback to make improvements as part of the design process, though.</p>
<p>This concludes the development of my interactive kiosk product. I believe I have been successful in reworking an existing product, in this case the Rocket League Esports website, for a new audience. My <strong>next steps </strong>for the next session/s is to write up a full, final evaluation considering all aspects of the process. In it, I also hope to outline some targets and goals for future development of this project and beyond.</p>

<p>With the annotations I discuss the layout and the various choices I made. For example, consistently having the menu button and "Championship Series" badge in the same places in the header to ensure continuity. I also detail my use of colour and font to engage the user. I demonstrate how I have styled different elements to establish a visual hierarchy, too.</p>
<p>Navigation, as you can see, is all within a single slide. This means that I can make the buttons larger and easier to interact with for a kiosk-based audience. There are also hyperlinked buttons elsewhere in the product, linking to external resources and also taking the user to other slides. The extensive usage of various interactive features makes for an engaging experience.</p>
<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p>I believe that I have had some <strong>success </strong>in reworking my chosen existing product, the Rocket League Esports website, and adapting it for a different audience. In this case, the switch is primarily from a website-based audience online to a kiosk-based audience. The main potential use case for my product would be in an exhibition hall at an esports-themed convention.</p>
<p>I think my user interface and experiences could have been <strong>even better if </strong>I more carefully considered the implementation of white space and usage of colour. While the bright, warm oranges and yellow/gold colours are engaging and captivating, the low contrast may impact the experience for users who can see less well or are less able to differentiate colours, for example. The layout is still quite cluttered, too, as you can see.</p>
<p>Now that I have combined my assets, my <strong>short-term </strong>goal pertains to exporting my interactive kiosk product. I intend to create a checklist of sorts that I can run through to identify any issues once I have exported it. After these checks, I will let my peers try my kiosk and leave feedback on the user experience.</p>
<p>My <strong>long-term goal </strong>is largely to start considering my final evaluation. I will review all of the comments I have left at the end of my blog entries as part of me taking a perspective approach to developing my project. I'll need to reference how the audience has changed and compare it back to the Rocket League Esports website.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of animations and interactive features will go a long way to enhance the user experience. They engage the user and keep them interested in the content that will be delivered to them by my interactive kiosk product. I identified a number of interactive features that I wish to recreate in my initial research document as part of the pre-production process for my project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think I want to include too many animations, but I will be able to use the functionality within PowerPoint to create a gallery as well as attract users to a start button on the splash screen.</span></p>
<h2>Animations</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have used the animations pane functionality included in PowerPoint to create a looping growing animation on the start button. I have used the same asset that I created a couple of sessions ago. This will attract users to the start button, having them press it to begin the experience with the trailer for RLCS that I also downloaded when collecting assets from the source.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/Animated-start-button.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-xs.PNG 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-sm.PNG 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-md.PNG 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Animated-start-button-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="803" height="765"></figure>
<h2>Interactive features</h2>
<h3>Videos</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish to include the trailer for RLCS that I downloaded while collecting various assets from the source. To remove the unnecessary details at the end of the trailer and therefore make it more appropriate for my new audience, I have used the trim functionality included in PowerPoint to remove the end portion of the video. The slide should automatically advance at the same time the video ends. The inclusion of a video will benefit users who have limited knowledge of the Rocket League Championship Series and Rocket League Esports in general. It will also capture their attention and generate interest in the product, encouraging them to check out the various pages to learn more.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/Video-trim.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-xs.PNG 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-sm.PNG 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-md.PNG 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Video-trim-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1493" height="848"></figure>
<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I considered the inclusion of various buttons with the creation of my own assets. I have always intended to incorporate a splash screen with a start button, and have animated it as detailed above. Buttons form the basis of kiosk navigation, as the device should be accessible with touch and by using a mouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I intend to include buttons on most pages. These will be hyperlinked to other slides in the interactive kiosk, or link to external sources that are not affected by the offline operation of the kiosk. By including information from official websites, I can still offer up-to-date information and resources, such as the live Twitch stream as PowerPoint does not natively support the embedding of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design of buttons, which I have already considered, have a large impact on establishing hierarchy and orientating the user. Some may be larger and more prominent to suggest significance, while others are much smaller and offer less relevant information or lead to slides that are predicted to receive less traffic.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/Buttons.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-xs.PNG 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-sm.PNG 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-md.PNG 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Buttons-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1150" height="784"></figure>
<h3>Gallery</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who are entirely new to the game, let alone any sorts of Rocket League Esports such as RLCS, I am including a gallery of in-game screenshots to help convey the gist of the game visually. As opposed to offering an entire additional slide full of written content about how the game works, by presenting these users with images instead, they are able to form the concept of the game much more easily and naturally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am using PowerPoint’s trigger animation functionality to show and hide larger versions of a screenshot when their respective thumbnails are clicked. Then, when you click the thumbnail again, the large screenshot will hide. This means that the user can select which screenshot they wish to view a larger version of. I have used many of the original assets that I collected at the beginning of the production process in creating this gallery system.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/Gallery.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-xs.PNG 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-sm.PNG 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-md.PNG 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/9/responsive/Gallery-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1488" height="774"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can incorporate this gallery into its own slide that will be targeted at users who need to get a better understanding of Rocket League itself. In turn, this will make for a more accessible experience.</span></p>
<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This session’s <strong>successes</strong> include the creation of various interactive features to include in my interactive kiosk product, as well as the use of some animations in a gallery and on a splash screen. These will be good for engaging the user, keeping them interested, and have them invest themselves in the information and experience that my kiosk will provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have been <strong>even better if</strong> I had created more gallery features to be used across my kiosk. The inclusion of a gallery full of Rocket League in-game screenshots will be highly beneficial to users who do not know much of the game and its premise. The same for images from LAN events, where teams compete in the same arena with each other, would also have gone a long way to further consolidate my introduction to the competitive elements of Rocket League.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This concludes my production milestone for my response to the brief. I intend now to shift my focus towards the post-production process of collating my assets and interactive features and combining them into my final kiosk product. I will begin doing so next session, establishing this as my <strong>short-term focus</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My <strong>long-term goal</strong> is relevant to the testing and gathering of feedback for my product. To accompany my consistent evaluation of each session’s work and achievements, I will also produce a final evaluation of my interactive kiosk once I have finished the project. These are important as they allow me to reflect on what went well and how I could improve my methods and approach to a similar product in the future.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially considering that I have created backgrounds with assets from the Rocket League Esports website, I should now look to using the master slide functionality in PowerPoint. With this, I will be able to apply the backgrounds to the homepage and all the content pages that I will need to fill with the assets created and copy that I have worked on in previous sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use the root slide in the master slide view to add colours and change the font. This will apply to all slide variations. You can also create your own types of slides, which is what I have done to achieve a different background for my homepage and content pages.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/8/Using-master-slide.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/8/responsive/Using-master-slide-xs.PNG 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/8/responsive/Using-master-slide-sm.PNG 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/8/responsive/Using-master-slide-md.PNG 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/8/responsive/Using-master-slide-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/8/responsive/Using-master-slide-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/8/responsive/Using-master-slide-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1855" height="850"></figure>
<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary <strong>strength</strong> from this session is that now I will be able to ensure consistency and continuity across all slides that I will create for my interactive kiosk product. This will go a long way to keep a positive and sensical user experience, where all slides will feel familiar and associated with each other and the Rocket League Esports website that I am reimagining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be <strong>even better if</strong> I added extra features to my template for the content slides. While I have been able to add a background and fonts that will be shared across these slides, it would save more time when putting the assets together if I sorted out the layout by adding shapes and extra text boxes now. While I can still duplicate slides, this will not be as efficient.</span></p>
<p>My <strong>short-term goal</strong> that I wish to complete in the next session(s) is to look at how I will be able to incorporate animations into my interactive kiosk product. I also want to refer back to my initial research for the various interactive features I identified. I can then port some or all of these across into a kiosk format.</p>
<p>In the <strong>long-term</strong>, I will need to consider how I want to set out the homepage and all of the content page. Now I have sorted out the master slide, it will save me from having to sort out the background each time I create a new content slide. I need to think about how I want to combine text with the assets I have collected and created.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have collected a number of assets from the Rocket League Esports website that I am looking to rework and adapt for a different audience in a kiosk format. However, there are a number of additional assets that I will need to create to accompany what I have collected. I can use what I have taken from the source and adapt them by harnessing various media production techniques. This will involve the use of Photoshop mostly, though PowerPoint also offers limited options for adding borders, recolouring images and such, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When creating and adapting these assets, I will follow my already established means of organising the files. Except, all of my new files will fall under a “Adapted / Original” folder at the top level, alongside the “Source” folder that I was using last session. I will ensure that I am using appropriate file formats, such as using .PNG where transparency is necessary and using .JPG for smaller files where it is not. I will also keep up with giving my new assets sensical names and placing them in a similar file structure. This will make my assets folder easily navigable and searching across all folders for particular assets will be easy, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using Google Drive for Desktop, I am able to access all of my files regardless of which device I use each session. My adapted and original assets will also be synced with the cloud for ease of use and access.</span></p>
<h3>Start</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to include a splash screen that will display at the start of the kiosk experience when it isn’t being used. I detailed this in my post about structure and layout. I have used the font identified when conducting my focused research and the colours, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To create the button, I used the shape tool in Photoshop to create a parallelogram and apply a gradient colour over the top. I then used the text tool to add the “Start” text, intentionally using bold weighting to emphasise it.</span></p>

<h3>Homepage</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted the featured buttons on the homepage to be eye-catching, and started first and foremost by creating a yellow-gold stroke. This draws the user’s attention to the content, and I have used the same font used by RLCS for the caption to ensure continuity and consistency. I have made use of two of the assets I collected last session.</span></p>

<h3>Menu &amp; Navigation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to create a selection of bold and prominent button designs to be used in a single menu and navigation slide. The size of each button establishes hierarchy, and some also use the assets I collected last session to further engage the user. To accomplish this, I had to use gradients for where I wanted the colour to fade out, and layers to display the text above the background colour. There was also the application of a faint drop shadow with the text to create distance and a sense of depth between layers.</span></p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All backgrounds will follow a consistent design. There should be a half-opaque bar in the top half of the background where the title will be placed. This will increase legibility, as I wish to use the same orange-gold colour for my text. I used the assets from the source I collected and used layers to reduce the opacity of a black rectangle I created with the shape tool.</span></p>

<h3>Fan Rewards</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used text, gradients to increase legibility, assets that I collected from the source, and layers to organise all of these. The differing sizes in text establishes hierarchy. I wanted to display some of the fan rewards that the user could obtain for watching the tournaments live. These will all be displayed on a fan rewards slide.</span></p>

<h3>Logos &amp; Extras</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I added a drop shadow to the logo to create a sense of depth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also took social media platform logos from the Internet and applied them to an orange-gold shape that I created beforehand with the shape tool.</span></p>

<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main <strong>strength </strong>for this session was my creation of a multitude of new assets, and how I’ve been able to draw from source assets I had collected and features I had identified in my focused research. I will be able to combine all these assets into a final product for my response to the brief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be <strong>even better if</strong> I had created a few more assets from scratch as opposed to drawing from the assets I had already collected as often as I did. This would consolidate my efforts to adapt the existing website for a different audience in a kiosk format. While I have still managed to do so, making more assets entirely independently would further benefit me in reimagining an existing product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My <strong>short-term</strong> goal is to look at how I can use the master slide. I already have thoughts about how I could use its functionality to ensure a consistent house style throughout my product. This includes colours, fonts, and how I can use the same background with every slide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My <strong>long-term</strong> goal still looks to how I can combine my newly created and adapted assets with the source assets that I collected last session. To accomplish this, I will also need to consider animations and the various interactive features that I wish to incorporate into my product.</span></p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>The proper organisation of collected assets in a sensical folder structure is quintessential to an efficient workflow. In today's session, I have collected all the images, videos, and audio that I will need for me to rework the Rocket League Esports website in response to the brief. In my production documents folder, I have created a 'Source' sub-folder, which then branches into an intuitive setup with all the assets I have collected. At the top layer, I will also be able to make another folder for any adapted and newly created assets.</p>
<p>It is also important to ensure that all files and collected assets are named effectively and appropriately. I have ensured that all file names offer the necessary detail needed to understand its purpose and contents with or without a file preview. For example, "FR Instigator Title.png" makes it clear that the image is related to fan rewards ("FR"), and is the Instigator Title cosmetic in-game.</p>
<p>I have also considered file extensions and formats, balancing the need for alpha data in some assets (such as to allow transparency in a logo) and file size optimisation (where a .JPG might be used).</p>
<p>I am utilising Google Drive for Desktop to keep my files and data in sync with the cloud. This means that I will always have access to my files online, regardless of which device I am using.</p>

<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p>This session's <strong>strengths </strong>included my thorough consideration of file management and navigation when collecting and storing assets from the source (Rocket League Esports website). The setup is intuitive, and it is also stored in and synced with the cloud, so I can access it from any device in school.</p>
<p>It would have been <strong>even better if </strong>I was able to find individual .mp3 files for the in-game goal event chimes. While I still have all the audio, it is just in a single file, and I will need to cut through this and trim it down to the specific sound effect I want in the future. Having each chime sound effect separate would be more sensical.</p>
<p>Now that I have collected images, video, and audio, I can begin to look at creating my own assets in the next session as a <strong>short-term goal</strong>. I will also be able to adapt what I have collected and will also document this.</p>
<p>In the <strong>long-term</strong>, I will have to think about how I can incorporate the various interactive elements and features that I outlined in my initial research document. This included the use of buttons, galleries, and the inclusion of a video. I will be able to use the assets I have collected today for this.</p>

                <p>I am beginning the production phase of my reimagination of an existing product, specifically my reworking of the Rocket League Esports webpage. I have decided to do so with writing copy and editing the text on the source/original site. In doing so, I have also made use of hyperlinks to incorporate external, official source pages.</p>
<p>Text is essential to conveying meaning and purpose and the inclusion of hyperlinks serves to be beneficial. This will allow me to embed and draw in external information from sources not affected by the kiosk slideshow's offline-only operation.</p>
<h2>Writing, editing text</h2>
<p>I have collected copy from the source (the Rocket League Esports webpage) and adapted it for my response to the brief. In doing so, I have edited the font - changing the colour, adding bold elements and considered weighting, as well as add italic elements, too. This also includes hyperlinking words/phrases.</p>
<p>Consequently, the text featured in my final kiosk product will be more engaging and fit the design and layout more seamlessly. By cutting out unnecessary details, or alternatively adding more text where it is necessary, I have considered the user experience. This is designed to be a kiosk to be shown in an exhibition or showcase, and all users should be treated as new.</p>

<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
<p>I have used hyperlinks to bring in extra information and links to official, external resources from the original Rocket League Esports website. These links will be able to be opened in a browser from within the kiosk, and as such, can be used to provide access to other resources and information that can be kept up-to-date beyond the kiosk.</p>
<p>I can use the 'Action Settings' interface within PowerPoint to easily link up to external resources when an object is clicked. In this case, I have been able to highlight the text and apply the hyperlink to the Rocket League Twitch channel.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/hyperlink.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-md.jpg 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/5/responsive/hyperlink-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="780" height="564"></figure>
<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p><strong>Strengths </strong>included my use of hyperlinks to include access to external, official resources that will not be affected by the kiosk slideshow's offline operation. By linking to the Twitch channel, for example, users will be able to view the livestream.</p>
<p>It would be <strong>even better if </strong>I hyperlinked more of the text I have wrote and edited for my interactive kiosk. The same overarching reason for this persists - the kiosk will not be able to download and present data from the internet. Hyperlinks offer a means of showing accurate information from official sources.</p>
<p>My <strong>short-term goal</strong>, specifically for the next session, is to collect the sound, videos, and images that I will need for when I bring all of the elements together for my kiosk product. I intend to organise these in a sensical file structure, where all the files I will need for my product can easily be located with clear names.</p>
<p>My <strong>long-term focus </strong>remains on how I intend to bring all the elements together. This also includes what assets I want to and/or will need to create myself using production techniques I have previously experimented with. Eventually, I will also need to consider hierarchy can be harnessed to guide the user experience.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>I have conducted wider and focused initial research and identified key features, means of interactivity, sorts of assets I would need. I have also set out and determined the structure and layout of my reimagination of the Rocket League Esports website, in response to the brief while adapting it for a different audience.</p>
<p>I can now consolidate the creative direction I wish to follow and build upon my initial mind map and mood boards. Wireframes and visualisation diagrams are an adequate means of presenting how I wish my product to be designed and set out. In creating the following documents, I am satisfied that I have concluded the pre-production process.</p>
<h2>Wireframe</h2>
<p>Wireframes aid the pre-production process considerably, in that they allow you to create a quick sketch of where various elements will be placed and interact with one another. They are not time consuming to create as they are very basic diagrams, making them an efficient and effective pre-production document to produce and have on-hand during work towards the production and post-production milestones.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/wireframe-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-xs.png 300w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-sm.png 480w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-md.png 768w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://sebjensen.github.io/c2blog/media/posts/4/responsive/wireframe-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="783" height="533"></figure>
<p>In the above I have laid out two high-traffic slides that will be implemented as part of my kiosk and reimagination of the Rocket League Esports website. I used boxes with crosses to denote images, and lines to denote text/copy. I have also included buttons and other icons and annotations to the side of the wireframe to elaborate on features.</p>
<p>It was particularly quick to produce these two wireframes, thus proving their efficacy in terms of an efficient pre-production workflow and cycle. I was able to include the key details surrounding layout and features with ease.</p>
<h2>Visualisation diagram</h2>
<p>Visualisation diagrams as a pre-production document could be considered an evolution upon a wireframe. It still demonstrates the desired layout and design, and includes more detail, of the specific design elements I'm wanting to use. They are a lot closer to how the final product will look, but are still relatively quick to produce.</p>
<p>I have taken the two wireframes I already produced and have progressed them into a visualisation diagram.</p>

<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p>I have clearly demonstrated my <strong>strengths </strong>in the creation of my last two pre-production documents, two wireframes and visualisation diagrams. I have consolidated my creative direction that I set out initially with my mind map and mood boards and developed with my focused research and consideration of structure and layout.</p>
<p>It would have been <strong>even better if </strong>I created more wireframes and visualisation diagrams to aid my efforts towards the production and post-production milestones. That said, though, it is important to consider the significance of time management when responding to a brief, and I believe I achieved a substantial amount with the sessions I dedicated to pre-production.</p>
<p>My <strong>goals </strong>now shift to the production and post-production milestones. In the short-term I will have to consider how I intend to progress through the production cycle. I intend to begin with writing and incorporating text and copy into the kiosk, and use hyperlinks to connect slides and external links. As I work through this, I will also need to continually think ahead into the long-term and consider how I intend to piece together all of these different elements.</p>

This will satisfy the short-term goal I set out in my aim to take a perspective approach to the progression of my project. Following this, I will also consider the structure and layout and user experience of the product I am adapting for a kiosk format and wider audience.</p>
<h2>Identifying key assets</h2>
<p>I have built upon the brief reference to the assets I would need by dedicating part of the pre-production process to identifying media and sorts of media that are relevant to the reworked product I am producing.</p>

<h2>Structure and layout</h2>
<p>Ensuring I focus on the structure and layout of my interactive esports product will benefit me greatly when I begin utilising media production skills and techniques to rework the Rocket League Esports homepage. It can serve as a checklist of sorts, a specification that I can follow to ensure that I am including all of the functionality, information, and interactive features to create and develop a good, seamless, and intuitive user experience.</p>

<h2>Perspective project approach</h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong> include my direct response to my primary documented weakness from last session, the absence of substantial identified key assets. I have amended this by dedicating effort to the collation of various media that would be significant in my response to the brief.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses </strong>include the limited sample of key assets I have identified. However, I believe I have a satisfactory selection of assets that would be significant in my response to the brief. It is important to note that the management of both time and effort is paramount in maintaining an effective and efficient workflow.</p>
<p>My <strong>short-term goal </strong>now concerns the production of wireframes and visualisation diagrams, and I intend to achieve this goal in the next session. This will conclude my pre-production process upon completion.</p>
<p>In terms of <strong>long-term goals</strong>, my focus will now begin to shift to the production process, with consideration for the post-production process that will follow it. I need to round up my pre-production work and efforts before beginning to collect and organise the assets I intend to use as well as creating new assets that I need.</p>
